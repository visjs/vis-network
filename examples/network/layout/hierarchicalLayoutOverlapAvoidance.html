      </div>

      <p>
        Overlap avoidance increases the space between nodes depending on their
        size in order to prevent big nodes from overlapping. The value can be
        set from 0 which is the default and means no overlap avoidance at all to
        1 which puts the most space around nodes. Any value in between is also
        valid.
      </p>

        type="number"
