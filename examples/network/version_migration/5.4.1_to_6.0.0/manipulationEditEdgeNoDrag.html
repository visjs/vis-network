        <h2>Migrating from 5.4.1 to 6.0.0</h2>
        <h3>Edit Edge Without Drag</h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        The editWithoutDrag function receives from and to ids. According to the
        documentation it has always been that way. But in 5.4.1 (and for 3 year
        prio to this release) the manipulation.editEdge.editEdgeWithoutDrag
        function received internal node objects instead. As of 6.0.0 the
        behavior is in line with the documentation and other similar methods
        that is the from and to properties now contain the ids directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Old code that no longer works:
      </p>

      <pre>
const options = {
  manipulation: {
    editEdge: {
      editWithoutDrag({ from, to }) {
        const fromId = from.id
        const toId = to.id
        …
      }
    }
  }
}
      </pre>

      <p>
        New code that achieves the same result:
      </p>

      <pre>
const options = {
  manipulation: {
    editEdge: {
      editWithoutDrag({ from: fromId, to: toId }) {
        …
      }
    }
  }
